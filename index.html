                <!-- <p>When I first met BTS this past September, they were at the headquarters of their record company, Big Hit
                    Entertainment, in Seoul, South Korea, preparing for their live-streaming concert Map Of The Soul On:E. I
                    was at home in Los Angeles. I still am, and I will be for a while. Perhaps you can relate. But I do have
                    one of those Phillips Hue lighting systems that lets me change the color in my office so that I can at
                    least pretend I’m somewhere else. I figured if I couldn’t be with the guys in person, I could at least
                    trick myself into feeling like I was closer.</p> -->
            </div>
            <div id="page-3">
                <!-- <p>So I asked them: “If I want to get into the proper BTS headspace, what color should I be bathed in?” The
                    answer was unanimous, and I called it, and you probably did, too: purple.</p> -->
            </div>
            <div id="page-4">
                <!-- <p>Purple has a special meaning for the band and their loyal fanbase, known as ARMY; at a fan convention in
                    2016, BTS member V told the audience: "Do you know what purple means? Purple is the last of the rainbow
                    colors. Purple means I will trust and love you for a long time. I just made it up.” Since then, “I
                    purple you” has been an expression of love and unity among the fans.
                    So I went purple. It worked!</p> -->

                    Givenchy, Bottega Veneta, Valentino Garavani, Gucci, and Celine. Here are the individual digital covers
                    he shot, along with thoughts from each member of BTS on which of their songs define them best. We hope
                    you purple them.</p> -->
